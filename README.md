A computer vision–based drone navigation and perception project developed as part of the India Space Academy Winter Training Program.

Project Objectives

--- Target Acquisition: Detects circular landing pads automatically using the Hough Circle Transform.

--- Horizon Leveling: Stabilizes tilted camera feeds through image rotation and NumPy-based center cropping.

--- Safety Alerts: Identifies red “no-fly” zones using HSV color masking and computes a danger percentage.

--- Low-Light Enhancement: Improves visibility in dark conditions while preserving pixel integrity.

--- Movement Simulation: Applies horizontal motion blur to emulate high-speed drone movement.

Technologies Used

--- Python

--- OpenCV (cv2)

--- NumPy
